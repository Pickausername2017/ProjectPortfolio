About Each Project
#
Project Name: Activity 2
Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebooks
The project is part of my Environmental Education requirements (I'd like to teach EE using Data Science).  I am converting  NC IT'S OUR AIR CURRICULUM Activity 2 Module 2  into a data science intro module.  I have been making this in my own time.  This project was built using Jupyter Notebooks and Python 3.  I have outlined in the comments the libraries, and programming concepts covered. You will see the notebooks are similar showing essentially the same thing, the exception is how variables and lists are made.

Project Name: Dead and Company Dashboard 
Python, Plotly, Jupyter Notebooks  
About: This is my project for the Python for Data Science Bootcamp on Udemy. This project will demonstrate various skills gained while completin the bootcamp. 
Currently, the dashboard displays the total number of concerts played 
by Dead and Company since 2015.  This is the live project for the Dead and Company Pandas/Python project in the respository.  
This site may change and be updated to include Stats about songs played, tour openers.  In the future I'd like to add predictions about 
various songs that might get palyed during the next tour.
